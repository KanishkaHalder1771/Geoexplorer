================================== To-do List ==================================

Main program:

* Autosplit box once maximum results are given from a box scan. For this, a new
  entry in the config has to be added
* Change the design of the services a bit so development is easier:
  - logger.log_scan could be automated so user doesn't need to handle it
  - use a set of properties for a service. These "rules" are essentially
    the constrains of the service.
* Add filters. These can be services themselves or something else that filters
  away some of the markers by providing a criteria.
* Make it easy to link a populator service with a filter.
* Merging services should be allowed.



GUI:

* Make markers clickable. Once the marker is clicked, it should either show some
  info passed by the service or use Google Places to show info.
* Make it possible to change the marker icon. Use some default ones.
* Controls like PAUSE and STOP.



Logging:

* Save file downloaded from the service. At least on error for easy debugging.
