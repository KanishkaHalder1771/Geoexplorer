Description: This document contains the API used for adding services to Geoexplorer




==================================== Intro  ====================================

All services can be found at /classes/Service

Each service that uses network communication, will additionally need an entry
in /classes/Requester and /classes/ResponseParser




============================== Service Blueprint  ==============================

Each service should follow the following blueprint:

class myService:
   def search(box, logger):
      markers=[]
      markers.append(('59.3649300', '17.9940050'))
      return markers

markers is just a list of tupples in the form (latitute, longitude)

For each box on the map, search will be called. The object box gives the user
access to the specific area. The object logger is merely used in case logging
is wished to be added for the service. The interface for these objects are
provided bellow.




============================== Objects' Interface  =============================

---- Box object----

Properties:
	N	→ Coordinates of north of the box
	E	→ Coordinates of east of the box
	S	→ Coordinates of south of the box
	W	→ Coordinates of west of the box
	center	→ Coordinates of center of the box
	WN	→ Coordinates of west-north of the box
	NE	→ Coordinates of north-east of the box
	WS	→ Coordinates of west-south of the box
	SE	→ Coordinates of south-east of the box
	xMeters	→ Length of the horizontal side of the box in meters
	yMeters	→ Length of the vertical side of the box in meters
   
Methods:
	bounds()	→ Gives the bounds of the box
   

---- Logger object----

Methods:
	append(type, txt)	→ Appends txt to file specified by type
                       type is a string: scan or result




=============================== Gettools Library ===============================

In /lib/geotools.py some tools can be found that can be used to assist in the
development for a new service. This module is included in Service.py so you can
use the following functions directly inside your new service.

   dist(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2) → Gives the distance between two geographical
                                  points in meters
   middleLat(lat1, lat2)	     → Gives the middle latitude between two latitudes
   middleLng(lng1, lng2)	     → Gives the middle longitude between two longitudes
   getCountryCode(lat, lng):    → Gives the country code at specific coordinates.
                                  Return can be: 'UNKNOWN'', <country_code> or None
