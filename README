Description: Geoexplorer is a framework for geographic services that let your
             bypass many of the service's limitations like the topology. It
             further lets you log everything and see how the service acts visua-
             lly.



============================= Install dependencies =============================

Ubuntu 13.10:
Works out of the box.

Ubuntu 12.04:
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-lxml

Windows 7:
1. Download and install python3.2 from http://www.python.org/download/releases/python3.2.5
2. Edit windows path:
   a. Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings
   b. Click the Environment variables... button
   c. Edit PATH and append ;C:\python32\
3. Install the lxml3.2 from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.2.4



==================================== Usage =====================================

Running some examples:
1. Enter the directory "examples"
2. Run "python3 <example>.py", substituting <example> with one of the example files
3. Open /GUI/index.html with a webbrowser to see live what is going on

A log directory will be created with the log
files. The log files are being updated on-the-fly.



================================ Configuration =================================

The config.py keeps all the applicable options for Geoexplorer in a single file.
Each option is described bellow:


      GUI_PORT             -> Port being used for the communication with the GUI
      
      LOG_PATH             -> Folder name where logs should be stored
      LOG_SCAN_FILENAME    -> Name of file for logging of each box scan 
      LOG_STATS_FILENAME   -> Name of file for logging statistics fom each scanning session
      LOG_RESULT_FILENAME  -> Name of file for logging the results from each box
      NEW_FOLDER_EACH_SCAN -> Should a new folder be created on each new scan?
      
      'box'
      MAX_X_DISTANCE       -> Max distance in m. for a box' x axis
      MAX_Y_DISTANCE       -> Max distance in m. for a box' y axis
      
      'costs':
      PER_REQUEST          -> This is used by some services for statistical data.
      
      'limiter':
      BOUNDS               -> The coordinates lat, lng, lat2, lng2 for scanning. 
      
      'scheduler'
      NEXT_SEARCH_WAIT     -> Seconds to wait before going to next box
      ON_QUERY_LIMIT_WAIT  -> Seconds to wait when service hits query limit


NOTICE: If the values for an option is above of what a service allowes, it will
        be overriden by the service's default value.



=================================== Logging ====================================

There are three files for logging different things.

STATS:  Logging for the whole session
SCAN:   Logging for each box
RESULT: Logging for each box result (this will be essentially all the results
        summed up)



=============================== Troubleshooting ================================

The map in the GUI doesn't show any boxes.
A. Try to install the latest firefox web browser. The GUI will not work
   for old browsers(IE8 for example).
