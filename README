Description: Geoexplorer is a framework for geographic services that let your
             bypass many of the service's limitations like the topology. It
             further lets you log everything and see how the service acts visua-
             lly.



============================= Install dependencies =============================

Ubuntu 13.10:
Works out of the box.

Ubuntu 12.04:
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-lxml

Windows 7:
1. Download and install python3.2 from http://www.python.org/download/releases/python3.2.5
2. Edit windows path:
   a. Control Panel -> System -> Advanced system settings
   b. Click the Environment variables... button
   c. Edit PATH and append ;C:\python32\
3. Install the lxml3.2 from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/3.2.4



==================================== Usage =====================================

Running some examples:
1. Enter the directory "examples"
2. Run "python3 <example>.py", substituting <example> with one of the example files
3. Open /GUI/index.html with a webbrowser to see live what is going on

A log directory will be created with the log
files. The log files are being updated on-the-fly.



================================ Configuration =================================

The config.py keeps all the applicable options for Geoexplorer in a single file.
Each option is described bellow:
 
      GUI_PORT                -> Port being used for the communication with the
                                 GUI
      
      LOG_PATH                -> Folder name where logs should be stored
      LOG_SCANNING_FILENAME   -> Name of file for logging scanning steps
      LOG_SESSION_FILENAME    -> Name of file for logging statistics fom each
                                 scanning session
      LOG_RESULTS_FILENAME    -> Name of file for logging every single result
      NEW_FOLDER_EACH_SESSION -> Should a new folder be created on each scanning
                                 session?
      
      BOUNDS                  -> The coordinates lat, lng, lat2, lng2 for
                                 scanning. 
      
      'box'
      X_DISTANCE              -> Desirable distance in m. for a box' x axis
      Y_DISTANCE              -> Desirable distance in m. for a box' y axis

      'scheduler'
      NEXT_SEARCH_WAIT        -> Seconds to wait before going scanning next box

The 'service' entry is used as a template by the services and should not
be altered.



=================================== Logging ====================================

There are three files for logging different things.

SESSION:  Different statistics for the whole scanning session
SCANNING: This is the main debugging log file. Every scanning step is recorded
          in this file.
RESULTS:  This keeps all the results extracted during the scanning session



=============================== Troubleshooting ================================

The map in the GUI doesn't show any boxes.
A. Try to install the latest firefox web browser. The GUI will not work
   for old browsers(IE8 for example).
