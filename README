Description: Geoexplorer is a framework for geographic services that let your
             bypass many of the service's limitations like the topology. It
             further lets you log everything and see how the service acts visua-
             lly.



==================================== Usage  ====================================

1. Enter /examples
2. Run python3 <example>.py
3. Open /GUI/index.html with a webbrowser

A log directory will be created with the log
files. The log files are being updated on-the-fly.
